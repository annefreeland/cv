<div class=pagetitle>Bio</div>

<p>I teach and write (mostly) about Latin American literature and social thought. I started an undergraduate degree at the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellín and finished it at McGill, took on an unconscionable amount of debt for an M.A. from NYU, and am now approaching the end of a Ph.D. in the Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures and the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society at Columbia. My dissertation-in-progress looks at recent appropriations from the position of the state of a heterodox Marxist and post-Marxist Latin American corpus; my other major current project is a translation of René Zavaleta’s <em>Notes toward a History of the National-Popular in Bolivia</em>, which is now only slightly overdue at the wonderful Seagull Books. As a teacher, I’m interested in working beyond the traditional confines of the university, particularly in prisons, and I’m preparing to teach a course on critical theory in a women’s prison in 2015.<P>
