<div class=pagetitle>Teaching</div>

<p>I owe my commitment to teaching to Lori Pompa, Patricia Way, and Tyrone Werts of <a href="http://insideoutcenter.org/" target="_blank">the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program</a> and, more directly, to the incarcerated members of the <a href="http://insideoutcenter.org/graterford-think-tank.html" target="_blank">Graterford Think Tank</a> who co-facilitate the Inside-Out teacher training sessions and whose educational philosophy is in turn informed by the work of Paulo Freire and Myles Horton. I had consciously espoused a Freirian pedagogy long before participating in the training program, but it was through this encounter that what had been codified at the level of the intellect was inscribed at the ethico-affective level, changing the way I engage even with elite students (Columbia undergraduates) in a traditional university classroom.</p>
<p>I've had the privilege to work, in my very short teaching career, at both the bottom and the top of the educational hierarchy. I learned from the students of my Western Civilization course at York College (CUNY), at the bottom, to identify the exclusions from certain forms of literacy that produce a false ranking of academic and intellectual ability, organized along racial and class lines, and to begin to sabotage this system from within, to work with what students think and know by asking them to speak and write in their own language about what matter to them, that is, to engage with the course material at and through the intersection of their lives and the ideology of the course. At the top, the danger consists in that easy access to the terms of a discourse, even a critical discourse, facilitates its uncritical assimilation and instrumentalization in the service of the same system of ranking. The best antidote to this might be the abolition of grades, but short of this, it helps to encourage the kind of conversational exchange—in the classroom, online, and even in the process of writing and presenting final papers—that deprivileges learning as mastery.</p>
<p>Here's the only <a href="http://www.culpa.info/professors/10522" target="_blank">online testimonial</a> that I'm aware of to date. (Please note: I do not have a background in "Marxist anthropology.") Here's the <a href="http://annefreeland.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/syllabuslacv1020.pdf" target="_blank">syllabus</a> for the course to which it refers (which I didn't design, but would happily teach again with some cuts and tweaks).</p>
<p>And here's the <a href="https://www.academia.edu/7090351/Critical_Marxist_Thought_York_College_Spring_2015" target="_blank">proposal for a course I'm currently developing</a>, to be taught at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility through York College.</p>
